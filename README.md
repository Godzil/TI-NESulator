This is a cleaned version of the peTI-NESulator repository (all non free data has been removed)

Some part of the original subversion has been lost because of harddrive crash so the 
early stage of the project is completely lost. Or I would need to check all the
backups arount to recreate part of that history, but that not a fun thing to do to be
honest, and there is virtually nothing to gain from that.

This software is released under a three clauses BSD.

If you plan to use that project in your projects, I would be glad if you could just send me a message, I love to know where my work is used!
