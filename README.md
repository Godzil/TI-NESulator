This is a cleaned version of the peTI-NESulator repository (all non free data has been removed)

Some part of the original subversion has been lost because of harddrive crash so the 
early stage of the project is completely lost. Or I would need to check all the
backups arount to recreate part of that history, but that not a fun thing to do to be
honest, and there is virtually nothing to gain from that.

The source is given as is, I have to select a proper licence for this code, but concider
it to be in a 3 clause BSD with a non commercial clause:

- You are free to use that code and integrate some part in your project 
- Will need to state where some of your code come from
- This code is given as-is without any waranty of working as expected
- You CAN'T use that code for commercial product without my prior consent.
