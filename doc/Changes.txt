05/10/2007  V0.30 part 2 ... In progress ...
      - Start rewrite of mapper manager. The goal, like for plugin manager, is
        to allow in the future to have plugins or mapper in external libraries.
      - New sound layer using Allegro. Not really accurate, but more portable.
        A lot of work has to be done on this (especialy because the actual sound
        is really bad.)
      - Started a new source organisation. Should be the good one this time !
25/10/2007:
      - Savestate now work correctly (It was not loaded at the right time...)
      - Mapper manager seems to work correctly ok
      - [MACOSX] Buils options are better now
       

      - [TODO] Remerge old PPU debug utilities in real plugin form
      - [TODO] Change the make util. Maybe cmake ?
      - [TODO] Remerge all mappers with the new manager
      - [TODO] Rewrite UNIX Makefile for support new src organization.
	
03/05/2007  V0.30 part 1
      - Started the process of PPU total rewrite.
      - Bg seem to draw fine, sprite is under the way
      - Add new test rom
      - Blargg sprite_ram test sucessfully ^^
      - Correct a lot of bug in implementation of a lot of things.
      - Try to make it accurate as much as possible...
      - All Blargg PPU test pass with success (in fact only timing is not good,
        but it's enought good to let Battletoad work correctly... Maybe it's 
        sprite0 related)
      
03/04/2007  V0.29 
      - Totaly new memory manager
      - Simple sound support (only on UNIX, but maybe Windows & DOS can support 
        it)
      - New plugin manager (a gamegenie plugin like is under development)
      - New mapper manager
      - Large bug correction on mappers (MMC3 now behave correclty)
      - Large bug correction on larges things (like Signal handler now exit 
        correctly if a signal occure when in signal)
      - Output now much simpler & readable
      - New cart opening & internal strictures
      - A very good speed boost with the new memory manager (it's incredible, 
        without speed limitation I can now go near 300/350fps!)
      - Large part of code reorganisation (needed for the new memory manager and
        plugin manager)
      - And an incredible number of modification/bug correction and more and 
        more...
      - Switch to SVN source control
      - New command line parser (now it no more a stupid command line parser)
      - Palette is no more externalized. (removing some path bad behaviour with
        Mac/unix/Windows version)
      - Corrections on paddle emulation, now should work near perfect.
